Overview of the electrical, firmware, and mechanical design of this Slice.

## ðŸ§  Purpose

<!-- Briefly describe the function of the Slice -->

This Slice is designed to serve as a template slice for creating new SLICE modules, with variants supporting different mechanical and electrical configurations. Intended to standardize layout and encourage reuse.

### DUMP

- Supported MCU Dev Boards:
  - Arduino Nano Original (ATMega328P)
  - Arduino Nano Every (ATMega4809)
  - STM32 Nucleo-32 series (e.g. L432KC, F303K8)
  - Other Nano-format boards also supported:
    - Any MCU board using the standard Arduino Nano pinout and 0.1" dual-row 15x2 header format
